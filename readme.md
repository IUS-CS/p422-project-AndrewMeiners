# Project Proposal  

The application will be a personal website intended to serve as a resume

The server side component will store references to work history, education history, and any personal projects of note

The four views presented to a viewer will be:  

- [ ] A welcome/splash page
- [ ] A view with my work history and education listed
- [ ] A view featuring personal projects I am working on
- [ ] A view featuring technologies I am interested in learning to expand my skill set

A primary goal of mine while building this application will be to loosely couple the components to allow for further building of the FE/BE components in different languages. I believe that showcasing the ability to apply design principles to multiple langauge implementations is highly desirable in the current job market.
